Main Objective:
Implement a medical identity using a NFT to store EHR’s by segmenting and structuring the metadata stored in the NFT. Patients will be able to receive this NFT to a wallet (such as MetaMask) and use the token to read and identify EHR’s. This Token can be submitted to medical professionals via a web application/platform to view based on selected areas that is requested, this request will be sent to the patient to authorize before sharing to improve privacy. In addition, all health records shared with a healthcare provider or professional will be logged for patients to identify the scope of their shared data. When patients receive new reports, they are allowed to add or update new details to the NFT metadata as an EHR. This will assist in improving the convenience and efficiency of sharing necessary EHR’s with health providers.

Specific objectives
•	Implement a platform for patients to view all EHR’s and for healthcare providers/medical professionals to view EHR’s that is authorized by the patient to be shared.
•	Design a NFT metadata format which is scalable when adding new and specialized EHR’s.
•	Implement easy UI-friendliness and an easy-to-use user-experience.
•	Allow for combined storage of EHR’s from multiple healthcare providers
•	Reduce the overall transfer time and delivery time when sharing EHR’s
